<h1>DaveyBot</h1>

<p><em>A software/hardware system that plays "</em><i>Rock Band" and "Guitar
Hero", by Len Popp</i></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>See <a href="http://www.lmp.dyndns.org/daveybot/daveybot.html">http://www.lmp.dyndns.org/daveybot/daveybot.html</a>
for general information about DaveyBot.</p>

<h2>DaveyBot Software</h2>

<p>The DaveyBot program is written in C#. Its source code is in
the "DaveyBotApp" directory.</p>

<h3>Software Requirements</h3>

<p>The DaveyBot software uses the .NET Framework version 2.0
and DirectX 9.0 or later. It also uses
<a href="http://directshownet.sourceforge.net/">the DirectShowNET library</a>. It
requires a video input device that is compatible with DirectX (DirectShow).</p>

<h3>Running DaveyBot</h3>
<ul>
<li>Connect the Xbox 360’s composite video output to the computer’s
composite video input. Make sure the Xbox 360’s video output is switched to
"TV" (not "HDTV").</li>

<li>Connect the hacked Guitar Hero controller to the computer with a
USB cable. (Note: You can’t do this unless you hacked your Guitar Hero
controller like I did!)</li>

<li>Run DaveyBot.exe.</li>

<li>If the DaveyBot window isn’t showing the Xbox 360 video, click
"Setup" and select the correct video device and video input.</li>

<li>Run "Rock Band" or "Rock Band 2" on the Xbox 360. ("Guitar Hero"
will be supported too, someday.)</li>

<li>Start playing a song with the guitar or bass. (Currently only a
single player is supported.)</li>

<li>Just before the song starts, click "Play Game" in the DaveyBot window.</li>

<li>As guitar notes are detected and played, coloured blocks will
flash in the DaveyBot window. (The notes will be played, if you have your
hacked guitar controller hooked up.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "Grab Frames" button will capture about 10 seconds of video
images and save them in separate bitmap files. The files will be saved in a
directory called "DaveyBot" in your "Pictures" or "My Pictures" directory.</li>

<li>The "Check Frame" button will read and analyze one of these saved
bitmaps and display the results in a dialog.</li>

<li>The "Analyze" button will read and analyze all of the saved
images in a selected directory, and save the results in a text file.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Video Capture</h3>

<p>The DaveyBot software requires a video input device that can
receive the composite video from an Xbox 360 and works with DirectShow (which
is part of DirectX). DirectShow devices can be very complicated, so DaveyBot
may not work with all types of video capture hardware. It has been tested with
a couple of devices – a simple video input and a TV tuner.</p>

<p>DaveyBot is currently designed to work with video images that are 720 by 480
pixels in size. Different video inputs may have different resolutions, which
will probably not work unless the software is modified.</p>

<p>C# class: Eyes</p>

<h3>Note Detection</h3>

<p>Each frame of the video stream is analyzed to find any notes
coming down the screen and decide when they should be played. Different note
detection algorithms may be selected in the Setup dialog. These algorithms are
implemented in subclasses of the abstract class NoteFinder.</p>

<p>Notes are detected a short time before they are to be
played. There are two reasons for this: It allows flexibility for the software
to avoid graphic elements that obscure the notes, and it allows the software to
allow for time lag introduced in the video capture stack, which can be
substantial.</p>

<p>Currently, the note detection algorithms are based on a
fixed image bitmap size (720 by 480 pixels, with the actual image inset
slightly in the bitmap). The image size will probably be different if different
video input hardware is used, which will cause note detection to fail.</p>

<p>C# classes: Brain, NoteFinder and subclasses</p>

<h3>Playing Notes</h3>

<p>After notes are detected, commands are sent via USB to the
hacked guitar controller. The controller interface hardware appears as a serial
comm port in Windows. Each command is a single byte whose bits indicate which
buttons are to be pressed on the guitar.</p>

<p>Since notes are detected some time before they are played,
the notes are queued up until it’s time to play them. A different thread
de-queues the notes and plays them.</p>

<p>C# class: Fingers</p>

<h2>Microcontroller Software</h2>

<p>The DaveyBot software on the computer interfaces with an
Arduino-compatible microcontroller embedded in the Xbox 360 Guitar Hero
controller. The microcontroller receives commands from the computer and
simulates button presses on the guitar.</p>

<p>The source code for the microcontroller software is in the
"Arduino" directory. It was written using the Arduino programming environment.</p>

<h2>Hardware Interface</h2>

<p>The schematic design for the hardware interface in the
Guitar Hero controller is in the "Schematic" directory. It is in Kicad format,
as well as an image file.</p>
